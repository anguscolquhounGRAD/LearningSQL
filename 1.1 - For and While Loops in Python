# 1.1 FOR LOOP 

n = 5
hamburger = 1

for cheese in range(1, n+1):
    hamburger *= cheese

print(hamburger)

# above we are doing a factorial , we create a variable called hamburger that loops up the range
# from 1 to n+1, we must say plus one to include last number.
# we have set the range to increase or decrease based on the value we give n
# each iteration, cheese moves up one integer, and we times it by hamburger
# but hamburger is not only multuiplying with * but reasigning to new value


# Nested Loop, create a triangle of astrixes


for i in range(1, 10, 2):  #the third condition means we can make it go up (or down) in steps)
    print(i)

#TAKE BELOW THIS STEP BY STEP, task is to create a triangle of *'s

n = 3
for i in range(1, n+1):   #What we are saying is that when i is 1 for first iteration, 
    print("*", end= '')      #we print *, but print automatically creates a new line so by using end = ''
                              # it just adds a space instead of new line. The iteration happens again, printing another * and no new line


for i in range(1, n+1):  #First iteration, i equals 1 so then j loops, in the range (0,1) which only happens once because of the +1 rule
    for j in range(i):   #So because i equals 1 and print("*", end= '') is indented to first line, we run print * add no new line once
        print("*", end= '')  #since print() is attached to for j in range(i) and i is 0 in first iteration, then we do not run below which just prints nothing, effectively printing new line
    print()

# Second iteration, i is now 2, so for j, it runs print * space, once, so we get a star and space, but then j iterates to 2, so it prints * again and space
#finally new line is created with print() , and so on for n= whatever

# 1.2 While LOOP 

# In a for loop the values we decide to loop over or the range of values is fixed, what if the number of steps is unkown
# OR suppose the values which we loop are generated dynamically (not known in advance)


# Syntax 

while some_conditon:
    loop_body   #when the condition is true the loop below will run, once false we exit the loop without executing loop body
