# 2.1 Creating an Array

# Array is a data structure used to store many items in once place 

Shopping = ['bread', 'butter', 'cheese']

#We can create an empty array

Empty = []

#We can also create an array used to store data later:

Temperature = [0] * 365 
#This creates an array full of 365 0s 

# 2.2 Accessing Array Values

#How do we talk to arrays?
#Each element of an arrary is assigned a number called an index, starting from 0 as integers
#In Shopping, bread is 0, butter is 1 and cheese is 2. We can access a part of an array by quoting its index

Shopping[1]  #This is butter

#We cab change arrary elements as if they were seperate variables. Say we want to record
#On the 42nd day of measurement air temp was 25 degrees

Temperature[42] = 25    #On a side note maybe the textbook forgot that day 1 of the year is day 0??? Shouldn't it be 43

# 2.3 Modifying Arrays - We can add stuff to an array

Shopping += ['eggs']

Shopping.insert(0, 'ham')   # Textbook does not mention this but its a much better way in my opinion

Shopping = Shopping[1::]  #One way I learnt to slice arrarys 

# 2.4 Iteration over an array

N = len(Shopping)   #counts the number of elements in an arrary 

print(N)


#Number of days with negative air temp, lets make something up...

Temperature[30] = -5

def numberofnegs(Temperature):
    total = 0
    for day in Temperature:
        if day < 0:
            total += 1
    return total

print(numberofnegs(Temperature))


#2.5 Basic arrary Operations 

#So far we have len([]) which counts the number of elements
#and we have the repeition ['Hello'] * 3 == ['Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello']
#and we also have this [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 'hello'] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 'hello']

[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]

>>> [1 + 2 + 3] + [4, 5, 6]


#Membership operation , using in 

'butter' in Shopping  #Gives True



#Given array A consisting of N integers, return the reversed array

array = [2, 6, 2 , 7, 9]

def reverseint(array):
    reversedarry = []
    for i in array:
        reversedarry.insert(0, i)
    return reversedarry

print(reverseint(array))

#ARRAY QUESTION     




A = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3]
K = 2

def solution(A, K):
    blankarray = [0] * len(A)
    counter = len(A)
    for i in range(len(A)):
        new_position = (i + K) % len(A)             #I was somewhat close,
        blankarray[new_position] = A[i]     #Using the % command means that if the LHS
    return blankarray                    #Is smaller, then it will equal the LHS
                                         #If the RHS is bigger so say K=2 and i is 5, 
                                         #The new position flips to the other side because 7 % 5 is 2

print(solution(A, K))
